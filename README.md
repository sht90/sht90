Hello!

My name is Sam Taylor.

I graduated from the University of Pittsburgh in December 2020 with a BS in Mechanical Engineering and a minor in Computer Science.

I intend to use this github for fun personal projects. Currently, this almost exclusively pertains to puzzles. I'd like to expand my personal projects into robotics and control systems eventually; but for now, puzzles are easy inspiration for projects. For both solving and designing, I mostly prefer combination puzzles (15 Puzzle, Rubik's Cube, etc.), but I also have a soft spot for some word puzzles.

You can contact me the following ways:  
robolibra109@gmail.com is my personal email, which I check frequently.  
sht90@pitt.edu is my school email. Having graduated, I check this account much less frequently, but I still use it.
