# About Me

## Professional / Educational Background

I graduated from the University of Pittsburgh in December 2020 with a BS in Mechanical Engineering, a minor in Computer Science, and a 3.0 GPA. I also had the privilege of working for [Neya Systems](https://www.neyarobotics.com/) in Warrendale, PA as a co-op student. Between my coursework and my co-op, I honed my interests and I learned a lot.

### Notable Work

In my final semester at Pitt, I worked on a Capstone Project with three other students. I'm incredibly grateful that we were sponsored by [Aerotech](https://www.aerotech.com/) and mentored by two of their employees. My group's task was to automate a work cell around a mandrel that produced stents, with the goal of replacing human operators. The mandrel was highly precise and efficient, but human operators often failed to precisely or efficiently move small stents. We modified an inexpensive robotic arm, and were able to perform a successful demo of the fully automated work cell. Our robotic arm used a passive 3D-printed gripper, which was parametrically designed to work with stents of multiple different sizes. Though we were unable to meet precision requirements by the end of the semester, we were organized and thorough in our whole engineering process. We won 3rd prize for our department at the Senior Design Expo.

I unfortunately can't discuss many specific projects I did at Neya, but I got to the chance to develop lots of great engineering skills, which I *can* discuss. I often would use Solidworks and Lulzbot to rapid-prototype 3D printed hardware solutions, including sensor mounts and fixtures for testing. I developed plugins for simulated tests in Gazebo using ROS, C++, Linux, and Python. I also designed various other software plugins for various odds and ends: processing raw sensor data, applying vehicular controls, and more. Also, most "handy" mechanical skills that I know came from modifying and installing various hardware components during my co-op at Neya.

Another fun and notable project I did was in Pitt's Mechanical Measurements 2 class. Groups had free reign to design and execute a research project, and my three groupmates and I performed an analysis of 3D-printed transmissions -- especially focused on whether "Paradox Gears" (as demonstrated [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGAnmRb66s0)) held up against their more common counterparts: pulleys and spur gears. Perhaps obviously, the paradox gears were the least efficient; but my group used thorough methodology, and our presentation was a class favorite.

I also design original puzzles, some of which are accessible on my github. [This](https://github.com/sht90/flip-dot) is the repository for my FlipDot puzzle, an original twisty puzzle. It has a link to my CAD file for it in the Readme, and a playable simulator for the puzzle in Python. I also made [this Split Decisions puzzle](https://github.com/sht90/split-decisions/blob/main/SplitDecB01.png) using only tools that I made myself, in Python. I have code (and answers) for my Split Decisions puzzles in [this repository](https://github.com/sht90/split-decisions).

## General Interests

I really like solving problems with math and science -- I especially like geometry, mechanics, and coding. These broad interests have taken me pretty far during my education, and I look forward to seeing where they take me as a young professional.

Personally, my hobbies mostly center around puzzles and music.
I was a Radio DJ in college, and I greatly enjoy making Spotify playlists. This is my [Spotify profile](https://open.spotify.com/user/12182017070?si=f895136d22d34278). I also played trombone, baritone, and tuba in high school, although I don't play much anymore.
As for puzzles, I loves Rubik's Cubes, and the whole overarching family of "twisty puzzles." I enjoy solving, speed-solving, and designing twisty puzzles. That said, I dabble in a bunch of different types of puzzles: wooden/metal knots, word puzzles, pen-and-paper logic puzzles, and puzzle videogames. Many of the projects you'll see in this github revolve around puzzles.  
I also enjoy running and cooking, even though I'm not particularly good at either.
