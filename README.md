# My Projects

If you're interested in looking at my projects, I highly encourage that you look at my [Quick Look repository]() first. I use github to version control my projects, which does not always put my best or most complete projects in any particular place. The Quick Look contains my most presentable projects. But if you want to explore more, feel free to do so.

# About Me

## Professional / Educational Background

I graduated from the University of Pittsburgh in December 2020 with a BS in Mechanical Engineering and a minor in Computer Science. My final GPA was a 3.014, and I took the classes shown below. I've sorted them for easier reading.

  * Mathematics
    * Calculus - 1, 2, 3
    * Linear Algebra
    * Differential Equations
  * General Chemistry - 1, 2
  * Physics - 1, 2
  * Engineering Analysis (Unix, HTML, Javascript, Excel, Engineering Writing)
  * Engineering Computing (Matlab, C++, Research, Technical Presentation)
* Mechanical Engineering:
  * Statics - 1, 2
  * Mechanical Design - Intro, 1, 2
  * Rigid-Body Dynamics
  * Materials Structure and Properties
  * Materials and Manufacturing
  * Thermodynamics - Intro, Applied
  * Heat and Mass Transfer
  * Fluids - Intro, Applied
  * Electrical Circuits
  * Mechatronics

  * Assembly and Organization
  * Algorithms and Implementation
* Electives/Other:
  * Public Speaking
  * Intro to Psychology
  * The Art of the Essay
  * Crime and Punishment
  * Composing Digital Media
  * Principles of Scientific Reasoning

I also had the privilege to do a co-op (similar to an internship) at [Neya Systems](https://www.neyarobotics.com/) in Warrendale, PA. During my co-op, I learned many lessons, and I worked on many different tasks for many different projects.  
- I learned how to keep up with -- and eventually, enjoy -- working in a fast-paced professional environment, where I'd often have to juggle multiple ongoing tasks. Neya used Jira, Confluence, and Bitbucket, all of which I learned how to use on the job.  
- I designed various parts in Solidworks, and maintained BOMs using Microsoft Excel. Most of the hardware components I designed were frames and mounts for sensors or other hardware components, or props for various tests. Most of what I know about basic "handy" hardware skills, rapid-prototyping, and 3D-printing is attributable to this position.  
- I also was responsible for various tests. Sometimes these would be as small as designing and running individual unit tests, but I also had several larger testing tasks. One of my first-ever tasks at Neya required that I learn Jupyter, Python, and the basics of Kalman Filters to develop a proof of concept for a proposal for a client. Over time, I learned how to use ROS, C++, Linux, and Gazebo to produce a plugin that allowed me to teleoperate a vehicle in a simulated enviornment. This allowed me to perform parallel demos of our client's status quo and our proposed solution. I presented this demo to my supervisor, who in turn presented it to our client. I continued to produce thorough test designs, documentation, and results throughout my co-op.
- I also got a small start in software development at Neya. I designed several useful programs in C++. In addition to the plugins I designed for simulated vehicles, I also made programs for tasks like processing raw sensor data, or communicating from a remote control to a CAN bus. Neya definitely sparked my interest in software development, which inspired me to pursue and complete my CS minor.

In my final semester at Pitt, I worked on a Capstone Project with three other students. We had the privilege of being sponsored by [Aerotech](https://www.aerotech.com/), and mentored by two of their employees. My group's task was to automate a work cell around a mandrel that produced stents, with the goal of replacing human operators. The mandrel was highly precise and efficient, human operators often failed to precisely or efficiently move small stents. We modified an inexpensive robotic arm, and were able to perform a successful demo of the fully automated work cell. Our robotic arm used a passive 3D-printed gripper, which was parametrically designed to work with stents of multiple different sizes. Though we were unable to meet precision requirements by the end of the semester, we were organized and thorough in our whole engineering process. We won 3rd prize for our department at the Senior Design Expo.

## General Interests

Professionally, I really like mechanical problem solving, and I really like coding. I've had some glimpses into robotics engineering, controls engineering, mechanical design, and software development; and all seem fascinating. I also greatly enjoy testing, and working with simulations. I've had difficulty narrowing down my interests, but I look forward to entering industry and further developing my career interests.

Personally, my hobbies mostly center around puzzles and music.
I was a Radio DJ in college, and I greatly enjoy making Spotify playlists. This is my [Spotify profile](https://open.spotify.com/user/12182017070?si=f895136d22d34278). I also played trombone, baritone, and tuba in high school, even though I don't play much anymore.
As for puzzles, I loves Rubik's Cubes, and the whole overarching family of "twisty puzzles." I enjoy solving, speed-solving, and designing twisty puzzles. That said, I dabble in a bunch of different types of puzzles: wooden/metal knots, word puzzles, pen-and-paper logic puzzles, and puzzle videogames.  
Not that I'm good at either of these things, but I also enjoy running and cooking.
